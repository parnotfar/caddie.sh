🚀 Excited to announce the open-source launch of Caddie.sh!

After months of development, I'm thrilled to share this project with the developer community. Caddie.sh is a powerful, modular shell script that transforms your macOS terminal into a comprehensive development environment.

🎯 What makes it special:
• One-command setup for complete dev environments
• Modular architecture supporting Python, Rust, Ruby, Node.js, and more
• Built-in debug system and customizable prompts
• Seamless integration with modern development tools

🏌️‍♂️ Think of it as your personal caddie on the golf course of development - always ready with the right tools and shortcuts.
