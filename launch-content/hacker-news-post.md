# Hacker News "Show HN" Post

## Post Title
Show HN: Caddie.sh â€“ A modular shell script that transforms macOS into a complete dev environment

## Post Body
I've been working on Caddie.sh for several months and am excited to finally open-source it. It's a comprehensive development environment manager that eliminates the friction of setting up development tools on macOS.

**What it does:**
- One-command setup for complete development environments
- Modular architecture supporting Python, Rust, Ruby, Node.js, and more
- Built-in debug system and customizable prompts
- Seamless integration with modern development tools

**Why I built it:**
I was tired of spending hours setting up development environments on new machines and wanted a solution that could handle everything from Python virtual environments to Rust toolchains in a single, consistent way.

**Technical highlights:**
- Pure Bash implementation with modular design
- Data structure encapsulation and function-based architecture
- ShellCheck compliant with best practices
- Cross-module function management
- Debug system with global flags

**Getting started:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parnotfar/caddie.sh.git
cd caddie.sh
make install
```

**GitHub**: https://github.com/parnotfar/caddie.sh
**Documentation**: https://github.com/parnotfar/caddie.sh/tree/main/docs

I'd love feedback on the approach, implementation, and any suggestions for improvements. Also happy to answer questions about the Bash implementation or discuss the modular architecture.
